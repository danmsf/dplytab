Title: Tabulates Grouped Tables
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Dan Feldman
Maintainer: The package maintainer <danmsf@gmail.com>
Description: Tabulates grouped tables, reshaping the stucture of the data for flexible reporting 
of multi-level statistical summaries and contingency tables.
    The reason for this package was to naturally extend the dplyr language to output the results 
in multi-level tables that could be easily converted to html or exported to other formats. While
functions such as `ftable` and the `tables` package offer multi-level tables, they do not easily
print to html and do not naturaly extend the dplyr syntax.
